## Introduction
### What is DynamoDB?
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with 
seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed 
database so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software 
patching, or cluster scaling.


DynamoDB stores all the data in solid state disks (SSDs) and is automatically replicated across multiple 
Availability Zones in an AWS Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.
